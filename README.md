# Data Collector Pipeline

This repository hosts a lightweight pipeline used to simulate distributed data collection agents in a background environment. It is primarily intended for testing system endurance, performance tracking, and log extraction workflows using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose

This project runs scheduled collectors using ephemeral runners to:

- Validate CI job runtimes over variable execution intervals.
- Perform network I/O and log generation simulations.
- Test delayed executions and self-triggering automation pipelines.
- Emulate agent behaviors in resource-constrained environments.

> **Note**: This repo is intended for experimentation and self-hosted research.

## Workflow Summary

- **Agent Initialization**: Prepares a clean runtime environment and updates packages.
- **Collector Execution**: Runs the simulation for 20â€“90 minutes with randomized delays.
- **Log Extraction**: Captures output and processes runtime statistics.
- **Notification System**: Sends structured updates via Telegram bot.
- **Self-Retriggering**: The pipeline can auto-reinvoke itself to simulate continuous background activity.

## Use Cases

- Continuous Integration (CI) stress-testing.
- Log collection and synthetic telemetry generation.
- Benchmarking automation workflows across runtime intervals.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational and simulation purposes. No sensitive or production data is handled. Use at your own discretion.
